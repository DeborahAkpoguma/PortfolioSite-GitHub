                    <p>The purpose of this project is to perform data analysis on a dataset containing employee
                        information. By utilizing SQL queries, we aim to gain insights into various aspects of the
                        employees' demographics, employment history, and termination details. This analysis can provide
                        valuable information to human resources departments, management teams, or any stakeholders
                        interested in understanding the composition and dynamics of the employee workforce.
                    </p>
